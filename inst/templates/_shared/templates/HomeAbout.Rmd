This is an R-Shiny application that utilizes a template with the ability to switch themes (colors).  To view theme (color) options, click on the Options tab and select a different theme. 

This Shiny app is based on modules.  Modules allow the app UI and Server elements to be broken into separate files, thereby, making it easier to test and develop in a team environment.  

The intent is to provide a starting point for Shiny apps that are likely to be larger applications.    
The Simulation Tab is provided as an example for a simpler tab where the UI module is contained in a single file Modules/SimulationUI.R.
The Data Analysis tab is created as a more complex example is typically how a tab with sub items should be implemented.  For a more complex tab, a UI file should be created that calls the sub-elements.  In this example, the Data Analysis menu item on the left has two sub-items 1) Introduction and 2) Run Analysis.  In the file Modules/DataAnalysisUI.R the side bar menu is created with a call to DataAnalysisSideBarMenu and the UI is created by calling DataAnalysisUI.  Because a modular approach has been taken the DataAnalysisUI simply calls the modules (functions) to create the UI for when the user clicks the Data Analysis->Introduction and Data Analysis -> Run Analysis.  Since the Introduction and Run Analysis are separate modules in separate files it simplifies team development.  

This box in the UI was created with a color of "primary", see Moduless/HomeUI.R
